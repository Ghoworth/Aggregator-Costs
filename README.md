# Aggregator Business Cost Estimate Spreadsheet

Aggregators/Aggregation will form an important element in the development of a future low carbon power market, as they will ease the interactions of Electricity system operators with millions of potential customers. These commercial aggregators will need to be profitable if they are to survive and help the market prosper.  There is currently little data or detail on the costs and economics of such entities.  This spreadsheet presents
 a bottom up cost estimate of such an entity driven by the number of customers acquired, and in other work to investigate the economics of a potential aggregator in future electricity markets.
## Introduction
This is a spreadsheet of the operating (OPX) and capital costs (CPX) of running an 
aggregator business in th UK. Inputs allow users to change base asumptions by the suitable multiplication of base values by said input factor.

The values provided in this spreadsheet are based on the Authors industrial experience, from
 discussions with industry contacts and the work by the author and others on the SmartNet Project [1-6].
